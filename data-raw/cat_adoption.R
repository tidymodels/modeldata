# data from
# https://data.longbeach.gov/explore/dataset/animal-shelter-intakes-and-outcomes/information/
#
# We spoke with the Long Beach animal shelter on 2024-06-12 and they had some
# information about the outcomes. We're looking to define the event as being
# homed by the Long Beach animal shelter.
#
# `"community cat"` and `"shelter, neuter, return"` are animals brought in by a
# community member (or field officer) for care. They are not owned by anyone
# but are fed and given shelter by different people in the community. We count
# these as observed events.
#
# `"homefirst"` was a program where the pet was adopted with the promise of
# getting them spayed/neutered. We count these as observed events.
#
# `"rescue"`, `"return to rescue"`, `"transport"`, `"transfer"`, and
#`"return to rescue"` means that they went to a different organization that
# works to home them. These are censored data.
#
# We also talked about how long, after intake, they would be considered in the
# "risk set" of animals that could be adopted. This depends on the situation.
# Some animals in poor health need more time to recover and/or be treated.
# There is also a 3-5 day period to give the original owner (if any) time to
# claim it.
#
# For our analysis, we will not include any animals that were at the center
# for <= 1 week.
